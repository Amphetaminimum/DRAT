Dynamic risk stratification model predicting mortality in ICU




## Background

It is common for ICU patients to experience a wide range of complications, some of which may be life-threatening, others may resolve on their own.
"Failure to rescue" describes the failure to prevent a death resulting from a complication of medical care or from a complication of underlying illness or surgery.
